Experience after university graduation is **7** years.

I’m the person on the team you can rely on if you want to develop new
functionality without requirements and a task description, fix floating bugs that nobody wants, increase productivity
through system design taking into account restrictions and company policies, and you want a stable project even when I’m
not on duty.

The main development stack is **Java/Kotlin** ☕, **Spring** 🍃, **RocketMQ** 🚀, **Postgres** 🐘. Worked as a developer on
projects from different domains like risk management in bookmaker, logistic platform for retail emarket, ticket provider
in bank, insurance for network of medical institutions.
